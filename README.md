# Challenge-2

# Descriptiom
Challenge 2 coursework for UT bootcamp. This challenge represents
my portfolio on GitHub, with the challenges and projects to be 
completed, to show.

## Usage
This webpage is designed to be a portfolio for my 
GitHub projects that I will be tackling throughout my
time at the UT coding bootcamp for fall of 2023.

It features an 'About Me' section, to describe who I am,
a 'Work' section to show off current (and future) projects
[currently with placeholders for most], and a 'Contact Me'
section with ways of getting into contact with me. There is 
also a 'Resume' section on the top right.
