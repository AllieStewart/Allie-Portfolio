                <p>My name is Allie Stewart, and I am a student at the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp for fall 2023.</p>
                <p>Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute 
                  Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air 
                  In West Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days 
                  Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school 
                  When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood 
                  I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air" 
                  I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way 
                  She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it" 
                  First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? 
                  Hmm, this might be alright But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? 
                  I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air Well, the plane landed and when I came out 
                  There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here 
                  I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared I whistled for a cab and when it came near 
                  The license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare 
                  But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air" I pulled up to the house about seven or eight 
                  And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later" I looked at my kingdom I was finally there 
                  To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air</p>
